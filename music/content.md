# The infinite world of music

## Music

Let's start with that. We all know it, but what is it really? It's all around us, enchanting us. And yet all it truly is is a systematic organization of sound.
As simple as the definition can be, we created universes both around and with it!

## Music from nothing

Nowadays, there is a science describing about everything, of course there will be one describing how to "properly" create art that revolves completely around sound.
The building block of music is a **note**, it's just an instruction to play, but what and how? That's where **tone** and **length** comes in, I think length is somewhat self-explanatory,
**tone**, however, is much more complicated, in Western culture we have eleven distinct tones that repeat (a repetition is generally called an **octave**), we can compare them, one can be higher than other.
Not only that, but between every note, there is a certain mathematical relationship, and this relationship will be preserved even when we move around.

Of course music doesn't exist for a week, not a month, not a year, it's almost as old as humanity itself, and thus had some time to develop, and despite having 12 different tones in an octave,
we settled on different combinations of 8 tones, which help us establish a certain mood, we tend to name these **scales**. Of course there are tools we use to switch between those and it can get really complicated, but that's the magic. Although everything may seem tremendously difficult to take up, but once you reach a certain information threshold, everything is connected, you'll get to see an entire web form.

## Rhythm and its purpose

In the previous section I described notes and how each one has a length assigned. There's one fundamental concept yet to be mentioned, and the wild concept is... nothing!
Silence is the most powerful instrument, as it helps build suspense waiting to be released. A silence is just like a note, except it can't have a tone, it can only have its length.
A silent note is brilliantly named **rest**, and it helps us build the patterns in time domain, also referred to as **rhythm**. It's the part of music that dictates us when and how to move.
It's the heart and the drive of every musical piece, and should not be underestimated.

## Melody, intervals and chords

With rhythm out of the way, we can finally start building cohesive pieces. A **melody** is a combination of a rhythm and a succession of musical tones.
More than one note can be stacked in order to create musical context for the melody,
two notes make an **interval**, three or more notes form a **chord**, these are mostly used to provide musical context, also known as harmony.
