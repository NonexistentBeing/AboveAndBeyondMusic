                    <p>
                        Let's start with that. We all know it, but what is it
                        really? It's all around us, enchanting us. And yet all
                        it truly is is a systematic organization of sound. As
                        simple as the definition can be, we created universes
                        both around and with it!
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="music-from-nothing">Music from nothing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, there is a science describing about
                        everything, of course there will be one describing how
                        to "properly" create art that revolves completely around
                        sound. The building block of music is a
                        <strong>note</strong>, it's just an instruction to play,
                        but what and how? That's where <strong>tone</strong> and
                        <strong>length</strong> comes in, I think length is
                        somewhat self-explanatory, <strong>tone</strong>,
                        however, is much more complicated, in Western culture we
                        have eleven distinct tones that repeat (a repetition is
                        generally called an <strong>octave</strong>), we can
                        compare them, one can be higher than other. Not only
                        that, but between every note, there is a certain
                        mathematical relationship, and this relationship will be
                        preserved even when we move around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course music doesn't exist for a week, not a month,
                        not a year, it's almost as old as humanity itself, and
                        thus had some time to develop, and despite having 12
                        different tones in an octave, we settled on different
                        combinations of 8 tones, which help us establish a
                        certain mood, we tend to name these
                        <strong>scales</strong>. Of course there are tools we
                        use to switch between those and it can get really
                        complicated, but that's the magic. Although everything
                        may seem tremendously difficult to take up, but once you
                        reach a certain information threshold, everything is
                        connected, you'll get to see an entire web form.

                    <h2 id="rhythmanditspurpose">Rhythm and its purpose</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the previous section I described notes and how each
                        one has a length assigned. There's one fundamental
                        concept yet to be mentioned, and the wild concept is…
                        nothing! Silence is the most powerful instrument, as it
                        helps build suspense waiting to be released. A silence
                        is just like a note, except it can't have a tone, it can
                        only have its length. A silent note is brilliantly named
                        <strong>rest</strong>, and it helps us build the
                        patterns in time domain, also referred to as
                        <strong>rhythm</strong>. It's the part of music that
                        dictates us when and how to move. It's the heart and the
                        drive of every musical piece, and should not be
                        underestimated.

                        Melody, intervals and chords
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        With rhythm out of the way, we can finally start
                        building cohesive pieces. A
                        <strong>melody</strong> is a combination of a rhythm and
                        a succession of musical tones. More than one note can be
                        stacked in order to create musical context for the
                        melody, two notes make an <strong>interval</strong>,
                        three or more notes form a <strong>chord</strong>, these
                        are mostly used to provide musical context, also known
                        as harmony.
