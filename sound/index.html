                    <p>
                        Probably the best way to begin is by defining sound
                        itself. What is sound? <strong>Sound</strong> is a
                        signal - a value that changes over the course of time.
                        In fact it's a <strong>bipolar signal</strong>, meaning
                        its values can be both positive and negative. The
                        easiest way to put, it is the strength of pressure, most
                        often air pressure, which our ears then proceed to catch
                        and process it accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In real world, we deal with two kinds of signals, a
                        <strong>periodic signal</strong>, which repeats over and
                        over again, and random signal, more commonly referred to
                        as <strong>noise</strong>. In most situations, sound is
                        an intricate combination of these two.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What do we measure in sound? There is a copious number
                        of units we can look at, however there are three
                        fundamental which we will look at. First off, we measure
                        the immediate sound pressure in
                        <em><dfn title="Decibel">dB</dfn> = decibels</em>. The
                        second property we will look at is the
                        <strong id="amplitude">amplitude</strong>, which is the
                        absolute peak value of the signal. Last but not least we
                        can measure is exclusively in periodic signals
                        <strong id="frequency">frequency</strong>, which is how
                        many times the signal repeats over a certain time
                        period. We call this unit one
                        <em><dfn title="Hertz">HZ</dfn> hertz (Hz)</em>.

                        So how do we make sound? We use
                        <strong>oscillators</strong>, circuits that produce
                        continuous and repeating wave. There are 4 well
                        established wave shapes that oscillators commonly
                        generate.

                        A simple oscillator will generally only produce signal

                        the world of music, but as with everything, with some

                        Hamonic overtones and the fundamental

                    <p>
                        As previously mentioned, a saw wave is constructed using
                        a sine wave and its harmonics, so what are they? First
                        we need a little bit of backtracing, every periodic
                        signal has a frequency at which the values repeat. We
                        call this the
                        <strong>fundamental frequency</strong>, and if we have a
                        sine wave playing at this frequency, we call it the
                        fundamental. So what happens if we were to add a sine
                        wave at a frequency multiplied by an integer greater
                        than one? (we will call this integer n)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, we can notice that it will fit in times into
                        each iteration of the original signal, additionally, the
                        combined sound doesn't feel as two playing
                        simultaneously, it feels much more cohesive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So now back to saw wave - if we have a fundamental
                        frequency at 100Hz, then a saw wave would be the
                        infinite sum of harmonics at fractional amplitudes. The
                        table below shows how a saw wave at 100Hz would be
                        constructed
